## How-to guide

1. *Use git and optionally, an external website to push to*
Learn gow to use git and commit early and often. Optionally use a website such as GitHub to push your work to. Build a portfolio.
1. *Understand the problem*
Learn how to perform your own research. It's an incredibly useful skill which can be applied to anything in life. If you find the problem difficult, don't give up, break it down. Draw it out, write it out, do whatever you need to do to solve it.
If the problem you are facing is too easy, do a brain storm and add additional functionality and/or combine it with other ideas to make your software more challenging.
1. *Implementation*
Take the language you are most familiar with to start your project off. However, if the problem is too easy, pick a language you have never used. Don't be afraid to write awful code and don't worry about the best implementation. Get it written up first and then refactor, clean it up and so on.
1. *Test*
Write test cases up for your program. If you prefer paper then use paper, if you prefer Microsoft Word, use that, but get used to thinking about how you can break your software. Find problems, bugs and fix them. Repeat it over and over again and document it. Throw it together into your portfolio. Remember, commit often. If something goes wrong, revert back.
1. *Don't stop learning*
Now you have gotten this far, don't stop trying to challenge yourself. Keep a portfolio, keep a blog and keep adding to it. It will look fantastic to potential employers.
1. *Resources*
Wikipedia, Stack Overflow and Google.
Seriously this is all you will ever need. If you aren't getting results, you are not doing your research properly and you need to improve this. I can not state enough how important this skill is and it isn't hard. With these three websites you find your answers and if it doesn't exist, make a thread on Stack Overflow and by doing so you help other people out too.
1. *Literature*
Knuth: _The Art of Computer Programming_
Skiena: _The Algorithm Design Manual_
Cormen et al: _Introduction to Algorithms_
Russel, Norvig: _Artificial Inteligence: A Modern Approach_
Abelson, Sussman: _Structure and Interpretation of computer Programs_
1. *More challenges?*
